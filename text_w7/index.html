                Since the mid-1990s, new media art (NMA) has become an important force foreconomic and cultural development internationally,establishing its own majorinstitutions,! Collaborative, transdisciplinary research at the intersections of art.science, and technology also has gained esteem and institutional support, with interdisciplinary PhD programs proliferating around the world. During the same period.mainstream contemporary art (MCA) experienced dramatic growth in its marketand popularity, propelled by economic prosperity and the propagation of interna-tional museums, art fairs, and biennial exhibitions. This dynamic environment hasnurtured tremendous creativity and invention by artists, curators, theorists, andpedagogues operating in both domains. Yet rarely does the mainstream artworldconverge with the new media artworld. As a result, their discourses have becomeincreasingly divergent.

                MCA practice and writing are remarkably rich with ideas about the relationshipbetween art and society. Indeed, they are frequently engaged with issues that pertainto global connectivity and sociability in digital, networked culture. Given theproliferation of computation and the Internet, it perhaps was inevitable that centraldiscourses in MCA would employ, if not appropriate, key terms of digital culture,such as “interactivity,” “participation,”““programming", and “networks.” But the useof these terms in MCA literature typically lacks a deep understanding of the scientificand technological mechanisms ofnew media, the critical discourses that theorize theirimplications, and the interdisciplinary artistic practices that are co-extensive withthem. Similarly, mainstream discourses typically dismiss NMA on the basis of itstechnological form or immateriality, without fully appreciating its theoretical richness.or the conceptual parallels it shares with MCA.New media not only offers expanded possibilities for art, but also valuable insightsinto the aesthetic applications and social implications of science and technology. At its best, it does so in a meta-critical way. In other words, it deploys technology in amanner that self-reflexively demonstrates how new media is deeply imbricated inmodes ofknowledge production, perception, and interaction, and is thus inextricablefrom corresponding epistemological and ontological transformations. To its detriment,NMA and its discourses sometimes display a weak understanding of art history andrecent aesthetic and theoretical developments in MCA. Due to the nature of NMApractice and theory, as a matter of principle it often refuses to adopt the formal lan-guages and material supports of MCA.These are just a couple of reasons why itfrequently fails to resonate in those contexts.

                The perennial debate about the relationship between electronic art and mainstreamart has occupied artists, curators, and theorists for many decades. Ouestions oflegitimacy and self-ghettoization the dynamics of which are often in tension witheach other have been central to those debates. In seeking legitimacy, NMA has notonly tried to place its practices within the theoretical and exhibition contexts of MCAbut also has developed its own theoretical language and institutional contexts. Theformer attempts generally have been so fruitless and the latter so successful that anautonomous and isolated NMA artworld emerged. It has expanded rapidly andinternationally since the mid-1990s, and has all the amenities found in MCA, except,of course, the market and legitimacy ofMCA.'

                This scenario raises many questions that establish a fertile ground for discussion anddebate. What are the central points ofconvergence and divergence between MCA andNMA? Is it possible to construct a hybrid discourse that offers nuanced insights intoeach, while laying a foundation for greater mixing between them? Flow have newmeans of production and dissemination altered the role of the artist, curator, andmuseum? What insights into the canon of art history and into emerging art andcultural forms might be gleaned from such a rapprochement?
