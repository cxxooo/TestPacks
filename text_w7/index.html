            <h1>Contemporary Art and New Media</h1>
            <p>Since the mid-1990s, new media art (NMA) has become an important force foreconomic and cultural development internationally,establishing its own majorinstitutions,! Collaborative, transdisciplinary research at the intersections of art.science, and technology also has gained esteem and institutional support, with interdisciplinary PhD programs proliferating around the world. During the same period.mainstream contemporary art (MCA) experienced dramatic growth in its marketand popularity, propelled by economic prosperity and the propagation of interna-tional museums, art fairs, and biennial exhibitions. This dynamic environment hasnurtured tremendous creativity and invention by artists, curators, theorists, andpedagogues operating in both domains. Yet rarely does the mainstream artworldconverge with the new media artworld. As a result, their discourses have becomeincreasingly divergent.</p>

Indeed, they are frequently engaged with issues that pertainto global connectivity and sociability in digital, networked culture. Given theproliferation of computation and the Internet, it perhaps was inevitable that centraldiscourses in MCA would employ, if not appropriate, key terms of digital culture,such as “interactivity,” “participation,”““programming,’ and “networks.” But the useof these terms in MCA literature typically lacks a deep understanding of the scientificand technological mechanisms ofnew media, the critical discourses that theorize theirimplications, and the interdisciplinary artistic practices that are co-extensive withthem. Similarly, mainstream discourses typically dismiss NMA on the basis of itstechnological form or immateriality, without fully appreciating its theoretical richness.or the conceptual parallels it shares with MCA.New media not only offers expanded possibilities for art, but also valuable insightsinto the aesthetic applications and social implications of science and technology.
