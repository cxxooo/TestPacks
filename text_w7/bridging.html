    <h1>Bridging the Gap: Implicit vs. Explicit Influence
        and Medium Injustice</h1>
    <p>
        In an effort to bridge the gap between the discourses of MCA and NMA, I convened a panel at Art Basel in June 2010 with Nicolas Bourriaud, Peter Weibel, and Michael Joaquin Grey, two curators who, respectively, represent MCA and NMA, and an artist whose career has moved very fluidly between both worlds.3 One obvious indication of the gap was demonstrated by the simple fact that Weibel, arguably the most powerful individual in the NMA world, and Bourriaud, one of the most influential MCA curators, had never met before.4 Citing the example of photography and Impressionism, Bourriaud argued that the influences of technological media on art are most insightfully and effectively presented indirectly, for example, in non-technological works. As he wrote in his renowned book, Relational Aesthetics, “The most fruitful thinking ... [explored] ... the possibilities offered by new tools, but without representing them as techniques. Degas and Monet thus produced a photographic way of thinking that went well beyond the shots of their contemporaries” (2002, 67). On this basis, he further asserted that “the main effects of the computer revolution are visible today among artists who do not use computers” (67). On one hand, the metaphorical implications of technologies have important effects on perception, con- sciousness, and the construction of knowledge. But on the other hand, this position exemplifies the historical, ongoing resistance of mainstream contemporary art to recognize and accept emerging media.

        Photography, initially shunned as a bona fide form of fine art practice, became a central aspect of mainstream contemporary art practice a century later. This occurred not simply because photography was relatively unaccomplished compared to painting during the heyday of Impressionism (1874-1886), as Bourriaud suggests. Rather, the acceptance of photography was delayed primarily because of the rigid constrictions of the prevailing discourses of late 19th- and early 20th-century art, which were unable to see—literally and figuratively—beyond the mechanical procedures and chemical surfaces of the medium in order to recognize the valuable contributions it had to offer MCA of the time. Although the Museum of Modern Art in New York collected its first photograph in 1930 and launched the Department of Photography as an independent curatorial division in 1940, photography remained a poor relation in comparison to painting and sculpture for another half century. By the 1980s changes in the discourses of MCA, collector attitudes, and market conditions, and the practice of photography itself, resulted in the medium's warm embrace by MCA (though not as photography per se, but as art that happened to be a photograph). In the 2000s photography became highly collectible and expensive. Average auction prices rose in value 285% between 1994 and 2008, with works by contemporary artists Cindy Sherman and Andreas Gursky reaching auction highs of $2.1 million and $3.3 million respectively (West 2008). Video, equally shunned at the moment of its emergence in the 1960s and now the darling of MCA curators, reached a market peak of over $700,000 for a work by Bill Viola in 2000 (Horowitz, 2011).

        Regarding the reception of the “new media” of the 19th century, John Tagg (1993) has noted that the more experimental aspects of photography were not well assimilated and the impact of the discourses of photography and contemporary art on each other was highly asymmetrical: the latter changed very little, while the former lost its edge in the process of fitting in. Ji-hoon Kim (2009) has further observed that despite the extraordinary assimilation of video by MCA, much experimental film and video, particularly the sort of material championed by Gene Youngblood in Expanded Cinema (1970) and its progeny, has been excluded from mainstream museum shows while being celebrated in exhibitions held in new media contexts. Inevitably, new media and the longer history of electronic art will be recognized by MCA as well, once a potential market for it is developed and promoted. A proactive theorization of the issues and stakes involved may play an important role in informing the ways in which that merger unfolds. Needless to say, many in the NMA community are wary of losing this critical edge in the seemingly inevitable process of assimilation.

        Bourriaud's argument authorizes a particular history of photography aligned with a conventional history of art in which technological media remain absent from the canon. A history of art that accepts, if not valorizes, the explicit use of technological media, as in kinetic art and new media, will reconsider its precursors. In this scenario, one can imagine an alternative history of photography that celebrates the chronopho- tographic practices of Eadweard Muybridge, Etienne-Jules Marey, and Thomas Eakins concurrent with Impressionism. Such a revisionist history will recognize that such work consists not just of the images produced but of the complex and inextricable amalgam of theories, technologies, and techniques devised in order to explore perception. It will recognize, as well, the substantial transit of ideas between art and science (Marey was a successful scientist whose work influenced Muybridge, who conducted extensive research at University of Pennsylvania and collaborated with Eakins, both artists deeply concerned with biomechanics.) The important artistic, scientific, and hybrid art-science researches of these pioneers will be interpreted, moreover, as key monuments in and of themselves, not just as metaphorical inspira- tions for their contemporaries working with oil and canvas. It took decades, in fact, for these chronophotographic discoveries (to say nothing of the advent of cinema) to penetrate painters' and sculptors' studios. And when they did, they infected art with both implied and explicit motion and duration, as in the work of Duchamp, Gabo, Wilfred, Boccioni, and Moholy-Nagy in the 1910s and 1920s, subsequently influenc- ing time-based art including NMA.

        Bourriaud's comparison of photography during the Impressionist era with computers and computer networking since the mid-1990s is troubling for reasons related to his- torical incommensurabilities. The Eighth (and final) Impressionist Exhibition in 1886 predates the introduction of the Kodak #1 camera (1888), prior to which the practice of photography was limited to professionals and elite amateurs. By contrast, new media started becoming a widespread, popular phenomenon by the mid-1990s, with the advent of the Web (1993) occurring just four years prior to the appearance of an exhi- bition of net.art at Documenta X (1997) and five years prior to the original French publication of Relational Aesthetics in 1998 (the same year that e-mail became a Hollywood trope in You've Got Mail). Most importantly, since the 1880s, photography and its extensions in cinema and television radically altered visual culture, saturating it with images. The context of image production and consumption during the Impressionist era—and its impact on art—simply cannot be compared with how the image economy since the late 1990s has impacted art (to say nothing of how key artistic tendencies since the 1960s strategically shifted focus away from image-centric discourses.) This is especially true since the advent of Web 2.0 in the mid-2000s, when new media tools and corresponding behaviors transformed the landscape of cultural production and distribution: social media sites like Facebook, YouTube, and Twitter now compete with search engines like Google and Yahoo for popularity, “prosumer” is a marketing term, and critics debate whether the Internet is killing culture (Keen 2007) or enabling powerful new forms of creativity (Shirky 2008).

        Bourriaud's position is, moreover, at odds with the actuality of what he curates and writes about. For if he genuinely embraces the so-called “post-medium condition” as he suggested at Art Basel, then the exclusionary prejudice against the use of technological media in and as art would not exist. The curator would not favor indi- rect influences of technology on art and his discussions and exhibitions of contemporary art would be blind to medium. But that is not the case. Peter Weibel astutely picked up on Bourriaud's distinction between direct and indirect influences and pointed out the hypocrisy of valuing the indirect influence of technology while scorning the direct use of technology as an artistic medium in its own right. Weibel accurately and provocatively labels this “media injustice.” As Christiane Paul has noted, “Bourriaud's distinction would be an absolute oddity in terms of art history, theory, and practice; the most important reflections on video unfolded in the medium of video art itself (not in painting), which is true for almost every medium.”5 Indeed, the implicit/ explicit dichotomy that Bourriaud constructs serves as a thinly veiled rhetorical device to elevate the former member of the pair—the lofty, theoretical ideal—at the expense of the latter the quotidian, practical tool. This ontology, predicated on binary oppositions, must be challenged and its artifice and ideological aims deconstructed in order to recognize the inseparability of artists, artworks, tools, techniques, concepts, and concretions as actors in a network of signification. The gap between MCA and NMA cannot be bridged until such binary oppositions are expunged from discourse, rather than recapitulated in the positions taken by Bourriaud, Bishop, and other like minded MCA curators and critics.
