    <h1>The $34.2 Million Question</h1>
    <p>
        In this spirit of imagining a better way to inhabit the world (and a better world to inhabit), I initiated a Facebook debate on May 10, 2013 that placed in tension two different sets of values: those of the commercial art market and those of telematic art. In my status update, I asked:
    </p>
    <p>
        What would the world be like if Roy Ascott’s La Plissure du Texte, 1983 (or your favorite work of net.art or proto‐net.art) sold at auction for $34.2 million instead of an abstract painting by Gerhard Richter? In what sort of world (and artworld) would that be possible?
    </p>
    <p>
        Perhaps the most insightful response came from Caroline Seck Langill, who wrote, “And all that money would be distributed, like the artwork.” This short, sharp prod shrewdly suggested an alternative economic model derived from Ascott’s theory of “distributed authorship,” whereby royalties from the resale of a telematic artwork would be shared among the project’s geographically disparate participants.
    </p>
    <p>
        And why not? There are cultural economies in which the creation and hording/ multiplying of wealth for its own sake is not valued as highly as sharing, gifting, and ritual expending. Over half a century ago, Yves Klein’s Zones of Immaterial Pictorial Sensitivity (1959) brilliantly challenged the MCA market by juxtaposing capitalist models of exchange with the incalculable value of art. The “authentic immaterial value” of the invisible work of art could be acquired only through an exchange of gold (half of which was thrown into the Seine by the artist), for which the collector attained a receipt of ownership, which had to be burned to achieve full immaterialization.
    </p>
    <p>
        The basic conventions of the art market, for example, ease of exchange and signature, are not neutral qualities or formal characteristics. Rather, they embody deeply held ideological commitments, just as the basic conventions of Ascott’s telematic art embody deeply held ideological commitments. So what are the implications if these worlds collide and MCA ends up valuing most highly (and putting its money where its mouth is) a work that challenges its traditional values? If, as Langill intimates, MCA were to embrace Ascott’s La Plissure and its ideology of distributed authorship, it would be logically consistent for MCA actors to express those commitments by distributing the economic wealth generated by the sale of the work. What, after all, could generate more cultural capital in a gift economy than making a gift of the appreciation in value of an artwork that was a harbinger of participatory culture?
