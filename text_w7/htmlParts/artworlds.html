    <h1>Artworlds</h1>
    <p>
        The extraordinary pluralism that characterizes contemporary art does not conform to conventional historical narratives that suggest a linear development, if not progression, of art. The multifaceted nature of avant-garde practices emerging in the 1960s— from minimalism and conceptual art to happenings, Fluxus, and performance, to earth art, pop art, video, and art and technology—constitute a remarkable diversity of artistic exploration that was synchronous with the revolutionary youth culture of the time and the dramatic growth of the market for contemporary art. Although some of these tendencies either implicitly or explicitly shunned the art market/gallery system by refusing to produce objects that corresponded to the traditional forms of collecti- ble commodities, the market found ways of selling either physical objects or ephemera related to many of these practices. The recent popularity and collectability of video art demonstrates MCA's ability and desire to commodify relatively ephemeral art forms for which there previously was no market.

        The pluralism that emerged in the 1960s has multiplied over the last half century, fueled by brisk market growth for the work of living artists (to wit, the prices com- manded by Gerhard Richter and Damien Hirst) in combination with globalization and the increasing professionalization of the field. Globalization has brought an influx of non-Western artists, theorists, investors, and institutions, contributing great cultural variation and aesthetic innovation while simultaneously growing the market. Artists have opportunistically selected and combined the conceptual and formal inventions of various precursors to contest conventional notions of style, originality, and materiality. They have responded to emerging cultural transformations by exploring theoretical questions, social issues, and formal concerns particular to contemporary exigencies and cultural milieus, expanding the materials, contexts, and conceptual frames of art in the process. Professionalization has resulted in a growing sector of artists who earn a living teaching at institutions of higher education and therefore have the freedom, resources, and intellectual imprimatur to pursue non-commercial work. This is the scenario in which the notion of artistic research has taken a significant stronghold, spawning a growing number of practice-based PhD programs, and in which interdisciplinary practices involving new media art and art-science collaborations, in particular, have flourished. As a result of these factors, there are a growing number of parallel artworlds. Each of these has its own generally agreed-upon aesthetic values and criteria for excel- lence, historical/theoretical narratives, and internal support structures.

        Despite the critical recognition and museological acceptance of video, performance, installation, and other unconventional forms of artistic production, the contemporary art market—and especially the resale sector dominated by big auction houses— remains tightly tethered to more or less collectible objects, and the vast majority of works acquired are painted canvases and works on paper. It is no surprise that the flow of capital in the art market exerts tremendous influence on MCA discourses, through systemic interconnections between artists, galleries, journals, collectors, museums, biennials and art fairs, critics, and art schools. It is this particular contemporary art system that is known as “the artworld,” both by its own denizens and by those whose work lies outside of it.
    </p>

        Throughout this upheaval, MCA has retained, if not amplified, its influence as the primary arbiter of artistic quality and value through its control of the market. Moreover, despite the artworld's proven ability to commodify artworks that are not conventional objects, it has not yet successfully expanded its market to include (or exploit) some of the key parallel artworlds, such as the discursive, socially engaged, and collaborative artworks theorized by the likes of Grant Kester (2004, 2012), Claire Bishop (2012a), and Tom Finkelpearl (2012) or the work of new media artists theo- rized by scholars, including the contributors to this volume. This begs the question of how relevant MCA remains in terms of addressing contemporary exigencies. To what extent does it function as a vital discursive field for theoretical debates that have relevance beyond satisfying the demands of a self-perpetuating elitist system that brokers prestige in exchange for capital?
    </p>
    <p>
        This purposely provocative question is hardly new. The difference now is that parallel artworlds today have their own extensive, self-perpetuating institutional infrastructures that are far more highly developed and funded than the loose forma- tion of artists' collectives and alternative spaces of the 1960s and 1970s. In other words, the MCA artworld in the 2000s and 2010s has much more serious competition than ever before. While it may retain authority regarding questions of market value, it has lost much of its authority with respect to a broader critical discourse because in that domain it is not the only (or most interesting) game in town. Indeed, as of this writing, the Google citation index of Lev Manovich's The Language of New Media (2001) exceeds that of all the works published throughout their careers by Rosalind Krauss, Hal Foster, and Nicholas Bourriaud combined!

        Three decades ago, art critic John Perreault observed that “the art system— composed of dealers, collectors, investors, curators, and artists—could continue with- out any good art at all” (Heartney 2012). Noting that “many artists use digital technology,” Claire Bishop's Artforum article “Digital Divide” (2012b) asked a provocative and insightful question: “how many really confront the question of what it means to think, see, and filter affect through the digital? How many thematize this, or reflect deeply on how we experience, and are altered by, the digitization of our exist- ence?” Unfortunately, Bishop limited her discussion to “the mainstream art world” and dismissed the “sphere of 'new media' art” as a “specialized field of its own.” As a result, she could only “count on one hand the works of art that do seem to undertake this task.” When Bishop was called to task in print (Cornell and Droitcour 2013) for her exclusion of NMA, she rebutted that “new media or digital art” were “beyond the purview of my article and [...] my expertise” (2013). Could a contemporary art historian/critic be taken seriously if s/he stated that performance or video or installation lay beyond their expertise? Bishop's admission of ignorance, made without a hint of embarrassment, is a double-edged sword: even as she acknowledges the presence of NMA, she self-righteously condones an account of contemporary art that ignores it, thereby reifying the gap between MCA and NMA that she ostensibly seeks to address. Indeed, such omissions from critical discourse are ideologically charged. As passive-aggressive forms of rhetorical violence, they strip that which is excluded of its authority and authenticity, ensuring its subaltern status. Although Bishop deserves credit for raising the issue in a mainstream context and for serving as a lightning rod for the ensuing polemic, art criticism this shallow and ill-informed—if not willfully ignorant and hegemonic—is destined for obsolescence or ignominy as a straw man. It unwit- tingly demonstrates Perreault's contention that MCA can continue without any good art, or worse yet, in blissful ignorance of a whole area of artistic practice.

        It must be recognized that the very notion of an “artworld” has been a problematic concept since Arthur Danto (1964) introduced the term. Sociologist Howard Becker challenged the notion of a univocal artworld, claiming that there were multiple art- worlds. According to Becker, each of the many artworlds consists of a “network of people whose cooperative activity, organized via their joint knowledge of conventional means of doing things, produces the kind of art works that [particular] art world is noted for” (Becker 1982, x). That said, and despite great pluralism and internal friction, there is arguably a more or less coherent network in contemporary art that dominates the most prestigious and powerful institutions. This is not to propose a conspiracy theory but to observe a dynamic, functioning system.
    </p>
    <p>
        Further, following Perreault, the mainstream contemporary artworld (MCA) does not need new media art (NMA); or at least it does not need NMA in order to justify its authority. Indeed, the domination of MCA is so absolute that the term “artworld” is synonymous with it. Despite the distinguished outcomes generated by the entwine- ment of art, science, and technology for hundreds of years and especially in the last century, MCA collectors, curators, and institutions struggle to recognize NMA as a valid, much less valuable, contribution to the history of art. As Magdalena Sawon, co-founder/co-director of Postmasters Gallery notes, NMA does not meet familiar expectations of what art should look like, feel like, and consist of based on “hundreds of years of painting and sculpture.”2 It is deemed uncollectible because, as Christie's contemporary art expert Amy Cappellazzo observes, “collectors get confused and concerned about things that plug in” (Thornton 2008, 21).

        The operational logic of the MCA—its job, so to speak—demands that it continually absorb and be energized by artistic innovation, while maintaining and expanding its own firmly entrenched structures of power in museums, fairs, and biennials, art stars, collectors, galleries, auction houses, journals, canonical literature, and university departments. This is by no means a simple balancing act and each of these actors has a vested interest in minimizing volatility and reinforcing the status quo, while maximizing their own rewards in a highly competitive environment. Their power lies in their authoritative command of the history and current practices of MCA and in promoting consensus and confidence in the market that animates it. As such, their power, authority, financial investment, and influence are imperiled by perceived inter- lopers, such as NMA, which lie outside their expertise and which, in form and content, challenge many of MCA's foundations, including the structure of its commercial market. Witness, for example, the distress of the “big four” labels of the music recording industry over the incursion of new media into established channels of distribution. From this perspective, there are substantial reasons for the old guard to prevent the storming of the gates, or at least to bar the gates for as long as possible. Typical strategies include ignoring interlopers altogether or dismissing them on superficial grounds. NMA, if not ignored (e.g., Bishop), is typically dismissed on the basis of its technological materiality but without recognition or understanding of its conceptual dimensions and its numerous parallels with the concerns of MCA (Shanken 2001; Murray 2007). At the same time, Jack Burnham, who championed art and technology in the 1960s, was critical of the “chic superficiality that surrounded so many of the kinetic performances and 'light events'” and noted that, “there was ... more than a little of the uptown discotheque” in much of such work (1975, 128-129). So it is not surprising that similar criticisms continue to be made by both NMA and MCA critics, though unfortunately the latter tend to throw out the wheat with the chaff. The uneasy relationship between art and technology and between MCA and NMA has a long and complex history. But the growing international stature of NMA and the seemingly irrepressible momentum it has gathered make MCA's ongoing denial of it increasingly untenable.
    </p>

        For its part, NMA has achieved a level of self-sustaining, autonomous independ- ence from MCA that is perhaps unprecedented. Like MCA, NMA is marked by pluralism and internal frictions. Yet no other movement or tendency in the history of art since 1900 has developed such an extensive infrastructure, including its own museums, fairs, and biennials, journals, literature, and university departments that function independently but in parallel with MCA. In contrast to MCA, it (mostly) lacks galleries, collectors, and a secondary market. But new media art institutions and practitioners have found financial support from diverse corporate, governmen- tal, educational, and not-for-profit sources that are local, regional, national, and transnational. The Ars Electronica Center, in Linz, Austria, built in 1996, com- pleted a $40 million expansion in 2009. This may pale in comparison to the $429 million extension for the Tate Modern or the $720 million budget for the new downtown branch of the Whitney Museum. However, given that the population of Linz is under 200,000, $40 million represents a substantial and ongoing dedication of cultural resources to NMA. As suggested above, the number of scholarly citations for key works of MCA and NMA theory is also illuminating. Despite MCA's refusal to seriously reckon with NMA, NMA is, in a manner of speaking, an artworld force to be reckoned with.
