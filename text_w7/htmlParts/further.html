    <h1>Further Provocations</h1>
    <p>
        Regarding Bourriaud’s focus on implicit influences, it is worth exploring the idea that MCA that does not use new media may have something very valuable to add to the discourses of NMA. Along these lines, the curator suggests that,
    </p>
    <p>
        art creates an awareness about production methods and human relationships produced by the technologies of its day ... [B]y shifting these, it makes them more visible, enabling us to see them right down to the consequences they have on day‐to‐day life. (Bourriaud 2002)
    </p>
    <p>
        In other words, by appropriating the underlying logics of emerging technologies, taking them out of their native contexts and embedding them in more or less traditional artistic media, their effects can be brought into greater relief. Unplugged examples of NMA may offer potentially useful perspectives on how NMA can be more successfully presented in exhibition contexts and may also provide examples that demonstrate parallels between implicit and explicit approaches to science and technol- ogy, catalyzing the formation of a hybrid discourse that joins both.
    </p>
    <p>
        One of the frequently noted shortcomings of NMA is that it does not satisfy the formal aesthetic conventions of MCA. In part this failure can be explained, if not excused, on the basis of the nature of the media and the theoretical commitments of the artists working with them. For example, in some cases it is difficult to justify displaying a work of net art in an art museum or gallery. Doing so is arguably anti- thetical to what some NMA practitioners and critics take to be one of the conceptual and formal strengths of certain net art and post‐Internet art practices: creating work that need not be seen in any particular place, or in one particular form, much less on the high altar of traditional aesthetic values, but is designed to be seen, if not inter- acted with, reinterpreted, and recirculated, wherever there is a networked computer or mobile device—that is, literally anywhere. What happens to net art, and one’s experience of it, when it is corralled into a traditional exhibition context? Is it still net art or has it become a strangely neutered doppelganger? Expanding on David Joselit’s (2012) categories of “image fundamentalists” and “image neoliberals” (which fix art in originary cultural contexts or global financial markets, respectively), Brad Troemel (2013) has proposed the category of “image anarchists,” which reflects a “genera- tional indifference toward intellectual property, regarding it as a bureaucratically regulated construct [...] Image anarchism is the path that leads art to exist outside the context of art.” This is perhaps what MCA fears most.

        Citing Inke Arns, Quaranta (2011) asks, How can we “underline New Media Art’s ‘specific form of contemporaneity’” in a way that does not “violate th[e] taboos” of MCA? The direction that this line of questioning proposes must itself be questioned. Violating taboos has played an important role in the history of art. A peripheral dis- course like NMA occupies a clear vantage from which to reveal and contest the status quo. This position is enabled not just by the explicit use of technological media but by challenging the museum and gallery—or any specific locale—as the privileged site of exhibition and reception. The proliferation and increasing mainstream acceptance of socially engaged art practices that take place outside of museum contexts demon- strates that such challenges are far from unique to NMA. However, if NMA lies down and accepts assimilation on terms set by MCA, then much of its critical value will have been usurped.

        One must recall that, on the basis of conventional aesthetic criteria, Duchamp’s Fountain (1917) was rejected by the organizers of the 1917 exhibition of the Society of Independent Artists. Just as the canonization of such readymades demanded an expanded conception of what constituted art, so the acceptance of NMA within mainstream discourses demands an expansion of aesthetic criteria. In comparison with these early conceptual interventions, Duchamp’s kinetic, perceptual investiga- tions, such as his Rotary Glass Plates (1920) and later Rotoreliefs (key monuments in the history of NMA) are considered relatively inconsequential in MCA discourses. These works use electronic media in order to interrogate duration, subjectivity, affect, and perception. In so doing, they also contest conventional aesthetic values and demand a reconfiguration of both art and the experience of viewing it. Indeed, just as NMA demands a rewriting of the history of photography, so it demands a reconsideration of Duchamp’s kinetic, perceptual work as key monuments in the archaeology of time‐based art. 
    </p>

        The sort of deep challenges to the nature of art that Duchamp and Kosuth proposed, and that are posed by the best NMA, should be celebrated as a great strength. Yet, I am compelled to agree with curator Catherine David’s assertion that “Much of what today’s artists produce with New Media is very boring” (quoted in Quaranta 2011). To be fair, however, one must add that much of what today’s artists produce without new media is at least equally boring. Indeed, only a very small fraction of mainstream artists actually succeed in gaining recognition and acceptance of their work within the discourses of MCA. So it is not the case that NMA simply fails the litmus test of MCA, for most MCA fails too.
    </p>
    <p>
        Many works of art that employ the tools of new media and have gained mainstream acceptance generally are not acknowledged by MCA as works of NMA per se, just as the artists responsible for them often do not identify with the NMA artworld as their primary peer group. Electronic works by Duchamp and Moholy‐Nagy from the 1920s, structural films and early video installations by Michael Snow, Anthony McCall, Bruce Nauman, and Dan Graham in the 1960s and 1970s, the use of computer‐controlled electric light in the work of James Turrell, Jenny Holzer, and Olafur Eliasson, and the computer‐manipulated video installations of Doug Aitken, Douglas Gordon, Christian Marclay, and Pipilotti Rist, spanning the 1980s–2000s, all comfortably fit within both NMA and MCA discourses. Hans Haacke’s early technological and systems‐oriented works, praised by Jack Burnham in the 1960s and later shunned by Buchloh (1988), have been reclaimed (Bijvoet 1997; Shanken 1998; Skrebowski 2008; Jones 2012), part of a larger reconsideration of “systems aesthetics” (Shanken 2009). The use of computers by Frank Stella, James Rosenquist, and Sol Lewitt in the design and fabrication process is well known but hushed in MCA discourses. Robert Rauschenberg, best known as a pop artist, was also a central figure in the group Experiments in Art and Technology (E.A.T.), which he co‐founded in 1966. Although this aspect of Rauschenberg’s career is downplayed in MCA discourses, the artist famously promoted acting “in the gap between art and life,” which for him clearly included using technol- ogy as a valid art medium. Further, his collaborations with engineer Billy Klüver demonstrate a conviction to bridge the gap between art and technology, as in Oracle (1962–1965) and Soundings (1968).

        In “Paragraphs on Conceptual Art” (1967) LeWitt’s uneasy relationship with technology is revealed by the tension between his metaphorical claim that, “In conceptual art ... [t]he idea becomes a machine that makes the art” and his warning that “New materials are one of the great afflictions of contemporary art.” The ongo- ing prejudice against the explicit use of technological media by Bourriaud and others recapitulates this parochial and conflicted attitude. But there is much to be gained by recognizing and exploiting continuities between implicit and explicit uses of technology in art. Joining Lewitt with the practices of NMA, several of the conceptual artist’s wall drawings of the 1970s were interpreted by computer code in Casey Reas’s Software Structures (2004). Commissioned for the Whitney Museum’s artport web site, Reas asked several programmers to code Lewitt’s instructions in various programming languages. The outcomes yielded multiple forms, suggesting strong parallels between the analog interpretation of Lewitt’s ideas by the assistants who executed the wall drawings in physical space and the digital interpretation of those same ideas by pro- grammers in virtual space.

        Notwithstanding these parallels, MCA audiences and critics have trouble seeing the everyday appliances and vernaculars of computing (operating systems, applications, web sites, keyboards, monitors, printers) as aesthetic objects (Murray 2007). Similar difficulties were faced by the visual banality of conceptual art, the ephemerality and objectlessness of performance art, and the remote contexts of earth art, yet these tendencies managed to overcome their hurdles, in part by the clever marketing of saleable objects by dealers, a practice that, in some cases, can be interpreted as antithetical to the conceptual underpinnings of the work. But even in cases where the production of art commodities might be logically consistent with NMA practice, few artists have succeeded in producing visual forms that warrant merit on the basis of MCA standards.

        For the new media artist seeking to meet those standards, Jonas Lund’s The Fear of Missing Out (2013) offers a novel approach. A computer algorithm sifts through a database of “top‐ranking curators, works, galleries and artists,” generating the title, materials, and instructions for the “ideal work to create at a given point in [the artist’s] career, before she’s thought of it herself” (Rao 2013). As in many conceptual and post‐conceptual art practices, the actual objects are presumably less important than the underlying ideas but must nonetheless conform to MCA standards. Indeed, Lund observes he must “follow the instructions in a convincing way... [to] transform it into something viable” (Rao 2013). Here the idea includes an ironic meditation on (and mediation of) automated digital systems and Big Data, subjectively rendered aesthetic objects, and the MCA market. Figure 21.2 shows another of Lund’s works, Cheerfully Hats Sander Selfish (2013).

        We live in a global digital culture in which the materials and techniques of new media are widely available and accessible to a growing proportion of the population. Millions and millions of people around the world participate in social media, and have the ability to produce and share with millions and millions of other people their own texts, images, sound recordings, videos, GPS traces. In many ways early NMA works that enabled remote collaboration, interaction, and participation, such as Ascott’s La Plissure du Texte (1983), can be seen as modeling social values and practices that subsequently emerged in tandem with the advent of Web 2.0 and participatory culture. A YouTube video like Daft Hands (2007) can delight and amaze over 50 million viewers, spawning its own subcul- ture of celebrities, masterpieces, and remixers. If Lund’s algorithm and database are any good and he open‐sourced them, then in theory anyone with decent chops could make market‐worthy MCA objects. In this context, what are the roles of the professional artist, curator, theorist, and critic? What do they have to offer that is special, that adds value and insight to this dynamic, collective, creative culture? Why care anymore about MCA or NMA, per se? What is at stake preserving these distinctions and in distinguishing such artistic practices from broader forms of popular cultural production and reception? Do such distinctions merely serve to protect MCA and NMA from interlopers by preserving a mythical status to their exclusive, lucrative and/or prestigious practices?

        Bourriaud’s (2002) parameters for evaluating an exhibition offer some insight into
these difficult questions:
    </p>
    <p>
        ... this “arena of exchange,” must be judged on the basis of aesthetic criteria, in other words, by analyzing the coherence of this form, and then the symbolic value of the “world” it suggests to us, and of the image of human relations reflected by it [...]. All representation [...] refers to values that can be transposed into society. [spelling corrected]
    </p>
    <p>
        This general statement defines “aesthetic criteria” in terms of formal coherence, “symbolic value,” “human relations,” and the modeling of social values. As these terms are neutral with respect to medium and context, they offer the sort of openness that would enable the confluence of various artworlds.
    </p>
    <p>
        Specialized artistic practices offer poetic and metaphorical approaches to challenging issues, shifting values, and social relations. These approaches are substantively different from other disciplinary methods in terms of how they contest existing forms of knowledge and construct alternative modes of understanding. The approaches themselves are challenging due to the complex and often paradoxical layering of aesthetic concepts and materials. Like high‐level research in science and other disci- plines, the outcomes are often not comprehensible to laypeople who are unfamiliar with the field’s specialized disciplinary languages and methods. As such, they are unlikely to be popular on YouTube. But YouTube popularity is no more valid as a criterion for judging such artistic research than it would be for judging scientific research. Daft Hands is an iconic manifestation of participatory culture and is highly successful in terms of the criteria of that culture, that is, YouTube popularity. For all of its appealing cleverness, virtuosity, and style, Daft Hands does not, as La Plissure du Texte did, create a working model of a possible future world, much less accurately anticipate some key features of that world (i.e., the world of participatory culture in which Daft Hands circulates). To use Bourriaud’s aesthetic criteria, Daft Hands does not, as La Plissure du Texte did, imbue “symbolic value” to “the ‘world’ it sug- gests to us and of the image of human relations reflected by it.”
    </p>

        Ultimately, art research sets itself apart from popular culture by elaborating visionary, symbolic, and metacritical practices that respond to cultural exigencies. In this respect, technological media may offer precisely the tools needed to reflect on the profound ways in which that very technology is deeply embedded in modes of knowledge production, perception, and interaction, and is thus inextricable from corresponding epistemological and ontological transformations. This metacritical method may offer artists the most advantageous opportunities to comment on and participate in the social transformations taking place in digital culture today, in order to, as Bourriaud implores, “inhabit the world in a better way” (2002, 11–12).
