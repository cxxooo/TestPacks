    <h1>The Post-Medium Condition and Its Discontents</h1>
    <p>
        Far from embracing the “post‐medium condition,” Rosalind Krauss, who coined the term, considers it an alarming situation that must be resisted. Noting that Clement Greenberg saw the modernist avant‐garde as the “singular defense against the corruption of taste by the spread of kitsch’s ‘simulacrum of genuine culture’” (2009, 141), Krauss argues that the artists she champions—Ed Ruscha, William Kentridge, Sophie Calle, Christian Marclay—are “hold‐outs against the ‘post‐medium condi- tion’” and “constitute the genuine avant‐garde of our day in relation to which the post‐medium practitioners are nothing but pretenders” (Krauss 2009, 142). In place of traditional media, declared dead by postmodernism, these artists, she claims, have adopted alternative forms of “technical supports.” According to Krauss, Ruscha’s technical support is the automobile, Kentridge’s is animation, Calle’s investigative journalism, and Marclay’s synchronous sound. Such contentions, tenuous at best, limit the interpretation of highly complex works and practices to a single aspect— just as Greenberg did—obscuring the complex layering of ideas, media, and technical supports that converge in them.

        For example, by constricting Kentridge’s work to animation, Krauss misses the richness of the artist’s accomplishment in joining drawing, animation, performance, and storytell- ing. Kentridge’s direct, corporeal interaction with media demands recognition of the medium specificity and historical trajectories of the various practices he incorporates in his work, even as it embodies the post‐medium condition’s hybridization of media, which contests such specificity. Moreover, to focus on such formal concerns completely obscures the social and political conditions of apartheid under which the artist lived in South Africa, the critique of which is central to his work, to say nothing of the gut‐wrenching pathos of Kentridge’s existential reflections on the human condition.

        Limiting a work of NMA to any single “technical support,” be it Roy Ascott’s engagement with planetary consciousness, Susan Kozel’s exploration of embodiment and affect in projects such as AffeXity: Passages and Tunnels (2013) (Figure 21.1), or the Jogging’s Tumbler-based investigation of image and object economies, has the advantage of avoiding the discussion of technological media. But it does the same violence to the subtleties of the specific media—and media ecologies—that the artists employ in, and as part of, their work. It is, moreover, blind to social, political, affective, and emotional qualities.

        The artist Krauss singles out as the primary culprit of post‐mediality is Joseph Kosuth, whose offense appears to be a post‐Duchampian theory and practice that is not limited to medium‐specific concerns but demands a broader questioning of the nature of art itself, as articulated in his influential three‐part essay “Art After Philosophy” (1969). The best NMA arguably exploits precisely this opening up of artistic inquiry beyond a myopic fixation on medium or support, as heralded by Kosuth and others over four decades ago. The obsession with media in NMA is more of a problem for MCA critics than it is for new media critics; the latter apply a broad range of methods, including media theory, media archaeology, and science and technology studies to wrestle with the particularities of the various media employed, while also engaging with the profound meanings and affective experiences elicited by the best works. Not content to contribute to inbred modernist discourses (from which they have been excluded anyway on the basis of the superficial formal elements of their work), new media artists—like the artists engaged in nearly every successive avant‐garde practice before them, from cubist collage to performance art—have used unconventional materials and techniques to question the nature of art itself, often challenging the object‐oriented obsession of the MCA artworld and the dynamics of its market‐driven demand for collectible widgets. In accord with Bishop’s criteria, they seriously investigate “what it means to think, see, and filter affect through the digital [...] and [...] reflect deeply on how we experience, and are altered by, the digitization of our existence” (2012c, 334). Indeed, as our existence becomes increas- ingly digitized, the material emblems of cultural capital that MCA persists in peddling seem increasingly out of place, or at least increasingly in tension with, the actual flow of ideas, images, and artworks via computer networks and online distribution chan- nels. This tension is, in fact, as Artie Vierkant (2010) argues, a central concern of so‐ called post‐Internet artists (including Oliver Laric, Seth Price, and himself), for whom the artwork “lies equally in the version of the object one would encounter at a gallery or museum, the images and other representations disseminated through the Internet and print publications, bootleg images of the object or its representations, and variations on any of these as edited and recontextualized by any other author.”

        The gauntlet Krauss lays down to the post‐medium “pretenders” might appear to apply to most new media (and post‐Internet) artists. But this gauntlet does not really make sense in the context of NMA. The theories and technologies at the core of the historical development of new media tools, together with the artistic and social practices associated with their application, seem to occupy a hybrid stance, straddling medium specificity and a range of non‐specific tendencies, including intermedia, multimedia, participation, and convergence.

        On one hand, new media practices and discourses embrace medium specificity, paralleling structural film practices. For example, the early work of Steina and Woody Vasulka explores the intrinsic material qualities of video as an electronic medium, including the relationship between audio and video, feedback, and real‐time registra- tion. Similarly, theorist Hayles (2004) has argued for media‐specific criticism; Fuller (2008), Manovich (2013), and others have developed the field of software studies and cultural analytics; Shanken (2007), Paul (2008), Quaranta (2011), Graham and Cook (2010), and others have argued for critical and curatorial methods specific to NMA; and other contemporary new media discourses talk about digitally born entities, digitally native objects, digital research methods, network cultures, and so on.

        On the other hand, the foundational principle of digital computing theorized by Alan Turing conceives of the computer as a “universal machine,” one that can emulate the specific functions of any other dedicated device. This concept is distinctly at odds with medium specificity. Technologist Alan Kay’s conception and development of the Dynabook, a multimedia personal computer, which he theorized in the 1970s as a “metamedium” (1977), and the recent expansion of that concept (Manovich 2013), further distance new media practices and discourses from Greenbergian modernism. Contra Krauss, this affirmation of what might be called “postmedia multiplicity” should be embraced as a strategic questioning of the nature of media in artistic, technological, and social contexts. In other words, NMA’s refusal to uphold the specter of modernism is anything but a failure; rather, it signals success in pursuing, if not achieving, its own goals. In this regard its convergence with the more general evolution of MCA toward a post‐medium condition establishes grounds for forging a rapprochement between the two ostensibly independent discourses.

        Krauss’s retrograde claim that certain artists’ use of “technical supports” represents the “genuine avant‐garde of our day” and her condemnation of post‐medium practi- tioners as “pretenders” sets up an unnecessary binary opposition and an indefensible hierarchy of value. Like Bourriaud’s opposition of the implicit and explicit effects of technology on artistic practice, Krauss’s rhetorical crutch must be unhobbled and the system of values it serves to artificially prop up must be deconstructed. Perhaps one of the most useful contributions that NMA can make to MCA discourses is an under- standing of the relationship between materials, tools, and techniques that embraces both medium specificity and the post‐medium condition.
